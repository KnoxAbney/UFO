# UFO
houses files for UFO Invasion
These files house a short game of essentially hangman posed as a challenge on codecademy. 
All code was written by myself except for the ASCII art used to display misses in the game. That art was provided by codecademy.
Running Ufo.cpp or Ufo2P.cpp using UfoFunc.cpp in a bash terminal should allow you to play the game.
Ufo2P is the first iteration of the game and a randomized version, Ufo.cpp is to come.
Have fun!
